## We've all been in this situation. 

Your friend leaves their laptop open and unlocked, and naturally we start looking for a way to make them seriously regret it.
Well, look no further, mouthsounds.me is a new site that allows you to embed constant lip-smacking and moist speech into anyone's browsing experience.
As an added bonus, if they are logged into youtube, youtube will start to assume they *really* like asmr, and suggestions for it will start popping up on their homepage.
Then again, not anyone's. Since mouthsounds was originally a chrome extension, your friends with firefox were safe...

## ...until now

fire_mouth seeks to bring the experience of mouthsounds to firefox users as well.
Now the joy that comes from hearing your friends go "What the heck is that sound, where is it coming from?" can be heard from chrome and firefox users alike.
Firefox also lacks an indicator on tabs that are playing sound, so it should be even more difficult to pin down.
Enjoy.
